# Visulation-Tool
# By Shiqi Zhong

This is an interactive scatterplot visualization tool.

Given a CSV file, this program will load the file into memory. 
Then, the program GUI would allow user to choose which variables to map to the x−axis and y−axis of the scatterplot and draw the scatterplot points as gray circles.
Additionally, the GUI would also allow user to choose a third variable and use the circle radius to represent this variable.
